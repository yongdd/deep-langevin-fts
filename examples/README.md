# Note 
1. Examples only run 1000 Langvin steps to test perforamnce.
2. For BottleBrush and Star9ArmsGyroid, the domain sizes are not accurately equilibrated, and there will be an error within 5%. 
3. For BottleBrush and Star9ArmsGyroid, the grids number are not *2^n*. There will be performance drop of FFT due to undesirable grid size.
